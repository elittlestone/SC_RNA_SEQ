**I will be using Quarto, a super set of R Markdown for this Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis. Quarto allows for the creation of detailed scientific reports (along with other formats like interactive web pages, dashboards, etc.) to help encourage collaboration and shareability of bioinformatics workflows.**

**Along with Quarto, I will be using the package manager *pixi* for further reproducibility, as well as the data workflow software *snakemake* for handling input/output and making the analysis clear and easy to follow.**

The following links give instructions for downloading/installing and using these helpful tools. 

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

[Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/getting_started/)

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Once these tools are installed, the first step is to create a pixi environment.

```{bash}
pixi init sc_rna_seq_analysis --channel conda-forge --channel bioconda
```
